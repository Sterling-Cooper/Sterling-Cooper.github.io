Hi there, I'm studying for an MA in Technical Communication and E-Learning.

This reflective learning blog documents some thoughts on my studies and educational experiences.

I will be sharing my opinions on theories, tools, and techniques I've encountered so far.

In the top right of this page, you'll see a link named "[Blogs I Follow](follow.md)", where I've compiled a list of links to other blogs, podcasts, and websites on relevant topics.

Feel free to comment on any of these posts! To do so, you'll need to log in to your [Github](https://github.com/) account (registration is free!).
