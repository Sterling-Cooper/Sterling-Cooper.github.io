title: The Challenges of Internal Documentation
tags: internal-documentation
---

I am interested in how people communicate professionally.

I am interested in how knowledge flows through an organisation.

I am interested in how problems are solved with information.

Documentation plays a vital role in each of these interests. Consequently, some of my motivations for taking this MA are to learn more about technical documentation and writing. As I go through this material, I keep circling back to the challenges of internal documentation in the workplace. 

## Challenge #1: Documentation is Hard to Find

I have spent my whole career working for software companies, and internal documentation is always hard to find. This assertion feels counter-intuitive because, through a highly reductive lens, all software companies do is produce text. But therein lies the problem. There is too much text. There is code. There are code reviews. There are internal wiki sites. There is bug-tracking software. There are asynchronous group chats. There are Word Docs. There are Google Slides. There are dedicated documentation sites. And so on. Each medium can hold essential information, but there is rarely consensus on the “source of truth”. Even when there is agreement, it still leaves the difficulty of searching and retrieving information across many sources.

## Challenge #2: Documentation is Hard to Maintain

##### Figure 2: Maintaining documentation (Canva/formatoriginalphotos n.d.).

Starting a new Google Doc or a wiki page is cheap and easy. There is almost no upfront cost except the time a person is willing to spend writing it. If I look for documentation but can't find it, my instinct is to fill the gap. Of course, all I really know is that I couldn't find a particular document. See challenge #1. If the documentation already exists, then I have only duplicated the information. I freely admit I have done this many times.

If I look for documentation and _can_ find it, that is not necessarily a happy outcome. I might need to “fix” the document. Often, the information is out-of-date. Sometimes, the document is poorly organised. Occasionally, the owner of the document is now in a different department. Instead of fixing the existing document, it is more convenient for me to start afresh. I ashamedly admit I have done this many times.

## Challenge #3: Documentation is Hard to Write

##### Figure 3: Writing documentation (Canva/dalton00 n.d.).

Maybe I should be more specific. _Good_ documentation is hard to write. I'd like to think I appreciated this before starting this MA, but I most certainly do now. As a software engineer, how good you are at writing documentation is primarily a by-product of your interest in acquiring that skill. There are excellent engineers who write terrible docs, mediocre engineers who write great docs, and everything in between. It means that the quality of documentation varies wildly. There is very little training. Standards are makeshift. It all adds up to a lack of recognition of how hard it is to write good documentation.

I like to think I am good at doing this hard thing. But this course has held a mirror up to my sins! My inner monologue speaks in the passive voice. I hate using a plain word when a beautifully complicated word is sitting right there. I have an addiction to long sentences. I love adding extraneous information, or what Mayer colourfully describes as "seductive details" (Mayer 2022, p.188).

## Addressing the Documentation Challenges

As I progress through this MA, I am addressing these faults. I am more confident talking and presenting to colleagues about writing styles. I define my target audience before putting finger to keyboard. I am more incentivised to find and fix existing documentation. My writing style and tone have improved. These things are helping in small ways.

My eyes are open to topic-based writing. I can advocate for an editorial framework conforming to well-defined types that produces more standalone, modular articles (Baker 2013). I am forming opinions on tooling that makes creating and maintaining documentation easy. These things are helping in big ways.

So, in little and large ways, I am starting to make sense of the three challenges and how to address them. And yet, I have a feeling that something is missing. These challenges seem to be teetering on the assumption that the issue only relates to _producing_ documentation. Once the internal documentation is searchable, maintainable, and well-written, our problems will be no more. But what if nobody reads the docs that we produce?

## Challenge #4: Documentation is (Sometimes) Ignored

![PNG image representing the challenge of reading documentation by illustrating a confused man looking at a computer](https://github.com/Sterling-Cooper/Sterling-Cooper.github.io/blob/main/_assets/challenges-reading.png?raw=true)
##### Figure 4: Reading documentation (Canva/daltomimagephotographyn00 n.d.).

I can illustrate this with an example. Software is now a 24-hour business, and customers have a reduced tolerance for outages or downtime. As a result, software companies are adopting practices to ensure their sites and services are always available. One such practice is to document critical procedures and troubleshooting guides in [runbooks](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/clusters/runbooks/). The idea is that when something unexpected happens, engineers can use a specific runbook to find the information they need to resolve the problem quickly.

Runbooks are a rarity among internal documentation in that they are:

1. usually centralised so that they can be easily found,

2. regularly maintained as part of an audit cycle,

3. conforming to a standard format and style.

In other words, runbooks are an example of good internal documentation. And yet, I have seen teams bypass the runbook and make a phone call to the engineer who knows the problematic part of the system. This detour doesn’t happen every time, but it happens enough that I wonder about the effects of living with challenges #1, #2, and #3 for a long time.

## Moving Forward

Ultimately, the solution to all four challenges might be the same–strive to elevate documentation to the same level as code. Good habits will form over time. If you have seen this done successfully or can offer a counterpoint, please leave a reply!

Nonetheless, I suggest gathering qualitative and quantitative information on your organisation's mindset. Do you have a culture of writing good documentation? And do you have a culture of reading your documentation? It's not enough to answer yes to only one of these questions. And I'm not sure which question is more challenging to answer.
