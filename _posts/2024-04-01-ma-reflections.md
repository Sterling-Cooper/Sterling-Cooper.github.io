title: Reflections on an MA Programme (and Half a Career)

My decision to enrol in this MA will be forever entwined with my decision to take a break from my job.

## The Forty-Year Career

I’ve been thinking a lot about the forty(ish)-year career. I’m getting to the halfway point of this journey, and for the first time, I’m starting to think about my career in its entirety. Do I see another twenty-plus years on my current path, or am I at a fork in the road?

I started on this path as a software engineer. After a while, I became a manager. It wasn’t a role I aspired to, but I thought it would be interesting to try it for a while. Most managers make a bunch of mistakes when they manage a team for the first time. I know I did. But something interesting happened. I got a lot better at it. Being good at what you do is rewarding. So I happily kept doing it for twelve years.

I learned that to be a good manager, you have to be authentic. Trying to mimic another person’s style doesn’t work. You need to lean on your strengths. What I’m good at is communicating, listening, and empathising. But there’s a fine line between being a people-person and a people-pleaser. When I get the balance wrong, I carry other people’s problems like they’re my problems. I am more aware of this now, which helps. But the fatigue builds up.

After a while, another interesting thing happened. I realised I was running out of energy at the same rate as I was getting better at my job.

At some point, I passed through what I imagine is the “sweet spot” of management—the period when I’m comfortable in difficult situations, but I haven’t yet realised how draining it is. I’m not experiencing burnout, but maybe it’s waiting further down this path.

So here I am, looking at that fork in the road and where the paths could lead. And so I think about what I like doing. What am I good at? What satisfies me? Thinking about these things led me to do something I didn’t think I would ever do—return to university. 

## I Enjoy Writing

I’ve written a lot of technical documentation, user guides, onboarding guides, project proposals, team charters, performance reviews, etc. These are satisfying tasks for me, and I gravitate toward them. This course taught me so much about how to be a better writer. It has noticeably improved my writing style and document design. Most of all, it has injected purpose into my writing. I have a much clearer picture of my audience and what the reader needs from a piece of information.

## I Enjoy Solving Problems with Information

Lannon and Gurak (2022, p.29) define Technical Communication as
“the exchange of information that helps people interact with technology
and solve complex problems.” I have seen a few definitions of Technical Communication, but this one resonated with me the most. I’ve spent many years working with geographically dispersed teams. I’ve put a lot of thought into how information flows (or doesn’t) between people and organisations. How to distil information, set context and share knowledge. This MA has equipped me with a lot of complementary knowledge in this MA in things like communication context and communication models (Shannon and Weaver 1948). This has helped me to see communication as a way of explaining the complexity of organisational life.

## I Enjoy Design

I love thinking about design and jump at each (rare) opportunity I get to express this side of myself during my day job. Newsletters, presentations, posters, t-shirts, you name it. Some of the most enjoyable aspects of this MA have been the exposure to design thinking, colour, typeface, graphics, layout, accessibility, data visualisation, and much more. This has been some of the most personally rewarding content for me.

## I Enjoy Documentation

My eyes are open to topic-based writing. I learned about DITA. I can advocate for an editorial framework conforming to well-defined types that produces more standalone, modular articles (Baker 2013). I am forming opinions on tooling that makes creating and maintaining documentation easy.

## I Enjoy Thinking About Soft Skills

I’m really interested in how we develop interpersonal skills. Our discussions have enlightened me about distance education, learner engagement, and communities of inquiry.

## I Enjoy Documentation

Over the course of my career, I have become increasingly aware of how organisations approach documentation. This course has taught me about documentation architectures, topic-based writing (Baker 2013), and DITA. The practices I have learned in these modules have been some of the most immediately practical content for me. I have also learned so much about language and tone, and this MA has given me the freedom to explore how we verbally express ourselves in the workplace.

## The Fork in the Road

In short, I found many things that I enjoy in this MA. These are things that energise me and fill up my battery. A little over halfway through the MA, I decided to change direction. I’m unsure where the next stop is on this path, but I’m taking a break to find out.
