title: Reflections on an M.A. Programme (and Half a Career)

My decision to enrol in this M.A. will be forever entwined with my decision to take a break from my job.

## The Forty-Year Career

I’ve been thinking a lot about the forty(ish)-year career. I’m getting to the halfway point of this journey, and for the first time, I’m starting to think about my career in its entirety. Do I see another twenty-plus years on my current path, or am I at a fork in the road?

I started on this path as a software engineer. After a while, I became a manager. It wasn’t a role I aspired to, but I thought it would be interesting to try it for a while. Most managers make a bunch of mistakes when they manage a team for the first time. I know I did. But something interesting happened. I got a lot better at it. Being good at what you do is rewarding. So I happily kept doing it for twelve years.

I learned that to be a good manager, you have to be authentic. Trying to mimic another person’s style doesn’t work. You need to lean on your strengths. What I’m good at is communicating, listening, and empathising. But there’s a fine line between being a people-person and a people-pleaser. When I get the balance wrong, I carry other people’s problems like they’re my problems. I am more aware of this now, which helps. But the fatigue builds up.

After a while, another interesting thing happened. I realised I was running out of energy at the same rate as I was getting better at my job.

At some point, I passed through what I imagine is the “sweet spot” of management—the period when I’m comfortable in difficult situations, but I haven’t yet realised how draining it is.

So here I am, looking at that fork in the road and where the paths could lead. And so I think about what I like doing. What am I good at? What satisfies me? Thinking about these things led me to do something I didn’t think I would ever do—return to university. 

## I Enjoy Writing

I’ve written a lot of technical documentation, user guides, onboarding guides, project proposals, team charters, performance reviews, etc. These are satisfying tasks for me, and I gravitate toward them. This course taught me so much about how to be a better writer. It has noticeably improved my writing style and document design. Most of all, it has injected purpose into my writing. I have a much clearer picture of my audience and what the reader needs from a piece of information.

## I Enjoy Solving Problems with Information

In the words of Hayhoe and Brewer (2020, p.92), "technical communication is essentially a social study, one that tries to understand how people communicate with each other within technical domains." This description of technical communication really resonates with me. I have a lot of experience solving problems in a technologically-driven profession. I have spent many years working with geographically dispersed teams. I have put serious thought into how information flows (or doesn’t) between people and organisations, how to distil information, set context and share knowledge. This M.A. has equipped me with complementary knowledge in communication context and communication models (Shannon and Weaver 1948). This has helped me to see communication as a way of explaining the complexity of organisational life.

## I Enjoy Design

I love thinking about design and jump at each opportunity I get to express this side of myself during my day job. Newsletters, presentations, infographics, posters, t-shirts, you name it. Some of the most enjoyable aspects of this M.A. have been the exposure to design thinking, colour, typeface, graphics, layout, accessibility, data visualisation, and much more. This has been the most personally rewarding content for me.

## I Enjoy Documentation

Over the course of my career, I have become increasingly aware of how companies approach documentation. This M.A. has given me the freedom to explore how we organise content in the workplace. I have learned about documentation architectures, topic-based writing (Baker 2013), and DITA. I am fascinated by the practice of treating documentation development in the same way as software code development. I have been leaning on my [DevOps](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DevOpsCulture.html) background to apply continuous integration and deployment to the documentation process. The practices I have learned in these modules have been some of the most immediately useful content for me.

## The Fork in the Road

In short, I found many things that I enjoy in this programme. These are things that energise me and fill up my battery. A little over halfway through the M.A., I decided to fully commit to a new direction. I’m unsure where the next stop is on this path, but I’m taking a break to find out.
