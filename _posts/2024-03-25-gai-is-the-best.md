title: Generative AI is The Best and I Love It
tags: gai
---

There are many reasons to like Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI), but let’s start with this: _It’s exciting!_ Each new day brings a fresh set of ideas and possibilities. The emergent tools inspired by GAI have the potential to redefine and transform almost all aspects of life for the better. 

GAI could be a game changer for [digital education](https://www.unesco.org/en/digital-education/artificial-intelligence)! GAI could save lives with [personalised medicine](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/26/ai-personalise-medicine-patient-lab-health-diagnosis-cambridge)! GAI could [predict solar storms](https://www.nasa.gov/science-research/heliophysics/nasa-enabled-ai-predictions-may-give-time-to-prepare-for-solar-storms)! GAI could address [climate change](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2022/how-ai-can-help-climate-change)! It’s almost impossible to see the enthusiasm emanating from this research and not think we are on the cusp of an exhilarating period of human history.

## Products

What technology companies like [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) and [Google](https://gemini.google.com/) can imagine for us is only the tip of the iceberg. The Personal Computer (PC) was initially [sold as a word processor with email](https://rarehistoricalphotos.com/vintage-computer-ads/). Mobile devices didn’t explode in popularity until people started building [fun and useful applications](https://www.wired.com/2010/10/app-for-that/). Similarly, the popularisation of GAI will unlock all kinds of creative products and possibilities.

By way of example, I have already written about [my interest in collaborative learning and the metaverse](https://sterling-cooper.github.io/2024/02/19/emerging-immersive-technologies.html). In that article I wondered aloud whether advances in eXtended Reality (XR) are bridging the hardware gap to allow students in different countries learn and work together in virtual settings. Since that post, it seems like GAI is also rapidly closing the software gap.

One of the limitations I remarked upon with [Second Life](https://secondlife.com/) was the dated nature of the user experience. This shortcoming is largely a function of the amount of programming required to fill out an entire virtual world. Since that post, we have seen the introduction of Groq and Sora. [Groq](https://wow.groq.com/why-groq/) is a specialised chip that runs GAI models faster than conventional processors or GPUs. Meanwhile, OpenAI’s [Sora](https://openai.com/sora) is essentially a GAI pixel predictor that creates photorealistic videos. It suddenly doesn’t seem ridiculous to think that some version of Sora running on Groq could make videos in response to a prompt in real-time and present them in an XR headset. At this rate, the metaverse will be fully realised before this reflective learning assignment is due!

## Learning to Love the Prompt

Part of the brief for this assignment was for me to reflect on my experiences of using a generative AI tool. I thought about my GAI usage and realised that, besides [programming](https://sterling-cooper.github.io/2024/03/18/gai-is-the-worst.html), all my uses are really basic! Many of my prompts are attempts to cut down on administrative tasks. For example, I use [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) to create meeting agendas and draft document outlines. The most common interaction I have with GAI is to ask a Large Language Model (LLM) to explain a concept and then have a back-and-forth on the topic:

##### Figure 2: Q&A on the topic of TPUs with an LLM.

I know I could do more. I wonder if what is holding me back is a sense that this is somehow dishonest. I mean this partly in a very literal sense. I have a slightly irrational fear that _any_ interaction with GAI could result in some kind of plagiarism. I also mean it partly in the more abstract sense that perhaps asking GAI a question somehow robs me of the knowledge I acquired. For example, I just revisited Gagné’s nine events of instruction for my research project. Does using an LLM to recall that information neuter my prior learning of this subject?

## Changing How We Think

The rational part of my brain knows that’s not true. Access to an LLM’s ability to recall and synthesise information is convenient, but that’s not a threat to deep learning. Deep learning is being able to relate ideas to previous knowledge and experience; deep learning is finding patterns and linking underlying principles; deep learning is being comfortable teaching others (Weigel 2001). Deep learning is as crucial as ever. Maybe more so.

I imagine that people had similar reservations about the Internet. Nicholas Carr certainly raised concerns about the adverse effects of widespread Internet usage on cognition, memory, and concentration (Carr 2010). But history would say we had similar worries about [television](https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2004/12/30/we-used-to-fear-the-tvs-not-the-tv-programming/), [telephones](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/09/when-the-telephone-was-dangerous/626742/)… and so on all the way back to the [printing press](https://www.ancientpages.com/2021/09/18/why-did-first-printed-books-scare-ancient-scholars-in-europe/). 

I have [changed my mind on GAI before](https://sterling-cooper.github.io/2024/03/18/gai-is-the-worst.html) and will no doubt change my mind again. Ultimately though, the fears that greeted each technological advancement so far have been largely unfounded. People adapt. Changing how the brain works and how we access and process information can be positive (Firth _et al._ 2019). We know all this. And we also know it’s normal to want to hold on to our way of thinking about things. The lesson is not to hold on too tight.
