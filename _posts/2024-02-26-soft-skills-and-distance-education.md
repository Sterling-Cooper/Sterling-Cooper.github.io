title: Soft Skills and Distance Education

The primary assignment in last semester’s Research Methods in Technical Communication module was to create a research proposal. The research question I asked in my proposal was: “How do software engineering workers acquire soft skills?” My background as a software engineering worker will partially explain the title, so perhaps the pertinent question is—why soft skills?

Early in my career, a senior colleague told me that “software is a people business.” In many ways, this is a classic example of [business jargon](https://www.forbes.com/sites/groupthink/2012/01/26/the-most-annoying-pretentious-and-useless-business-jargon/?sh=cd476922eeaf). It’s punchy, maybe even profound—and the more it echoes in my head, the more it doesn’t seem to mean anything at all. 

However, in the context of our discussion, this phrase _did_ mean something to me. My colleague was trying to articulate how the success of a software company depends on each constituent unit’s ability to work together. For that to happen, individuals need to be able to manage relationships with customers, suppliers, colleagues, mentors, and many others. Even in the most digitally-focussed profession, the process of building a product is a thoroughly human endeavour. In that respect, “software is a people business” summed up his message quite succinctly. What he was describing was the importance of soft skills.

## Hard Skills and Soft Skills

The literature on skill requirements for software engineering roles makes a separation between the two categories of “hard skills” and “soft skills.” Hard skills are “the technical requirements and knowledge an individual needs to carry out a task” (Ahmed _et al._ 2012, p.1). Soft skills are the “competencies, behaviours, attitudes, and personal qualities that enable people to effectively navigate their environment, work well with others, perform well, and achieve their goals” (Lippman _et al._ 2015, p.4). The literature supports the conclusion that soft skills, such as communication, collaboration, and emotional intelligence, are increasingly recognised as essential for success in software engineering professions.

I had the good fortune to start my career in a small company that emphasised the importance of these skills. Talented communicators surrounded me, and I did what I could to soak up their methods. As my career progressed, I moved into management roles. That, too, shaped my perspective. I became more aware of job expectations and what skills propelled engineers to succeed in their careers.

I am convinced that soft skills are at least as important as hard skills. Think about an engineer with an average level of technical expertise. Suppose that engineer can expertly navigate conflict, build consensus, communicate their ideas, cultivate a positive culture, and get work done through others. Is that person more valuable to their company than a deep technical expert with average soft skills?

## How are Soft Skills Acquired?

I learned the core hard skills of my profession through formal education. I picked up some minor certifications and qualifications after leaving University, but I accrued most of my new technical skills by solving problems and completing tasks. I usually achieved this during quiet time or “[with headphones on](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/viva/insights/tutorials/gm-focus#best-practices).”

In contrast, much of what I know about soft skills has come through social interaction, observation, and face-to-face coaching. Over the years, my job became more about communication and less about programming. And yet, I received little formal soft skills training throughout my career. It is no coincidence that I was drawn to this MA to understand better professional communication and the theory and practice of learning.

I don’t think my experience is unique. It’s understood that curricula at the undergraduate level often emphasise hard skills. This leaves soft skills to be developed through social experience in the workplace, which is why they are sometimes referred to as “people skills” (Levasseur 2013).

All of which leads me to wonder whether this arrangement “[works as designed](https://www.webster-dictionary.org/definition/working+as+designed).” Engineers learn hard skills through formal education and solving problems. Meanwhile, soft skills are handed down from generation to generation like campfire tales.

Perhaps this is the way of things. But things are changing.

## Working Remotely

At first, things changed slowly. Improving technology allowed many software engineers to work outside the traditional office setting. This was largely considered a privilege. The ability to work from home while waiting for a plumber to fix the boiler became a perk of the job.

And then things changed quickly. [The pandemic made working from home necessary](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2022.111509) (Šmite _et al._ 2023). [Meetings moved to video conferencing apps](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/21/the-zoom-boom-how-video-calling-became-a-blessing-and-a-curse) (Kalia 2020). [Slack made asynchronous communication fun](https://www.theverge.com/24070725/slack-ten-year-anniversary-retrospective-groupchat-workplace) (Lopatto 2024). [A generation questioned their relationship to work and the workplace](https://www.vox.com/recode/22776112/quit-jobs-great-resignation-workers-union) (Molla 2021). Many software engineers now find it easier to complete tasks at home, where they have quiet time to solve problems and teach themselves new technical skills.

## Parallels in Distance Education

Sometimes I imagine what it would be like to start my career while working-from-home. What is the Microsoft Teams equivalent of endlessly badgering my desk-neighbour with setup questions? How would I soak up communication tips from my colleagues when I don’t see them in person? Could I miss out on useful information if I can’t absorb conversations occurring around me? Would I have the same ability to make friends with fewer chance encounters? If distance learning is instruction which happens when teachers and learners are separated by time, space, and/or distance, then I think distance educators are grappling with the same questions (Driscoll 2002).

As part of this semester’s E-learning Theories and Practices module, we have been discussing the paradigm shift that e-learning represents for distance education. Educators want to embrace the advantages of e-learning technologies to access information and sustain educational discourse. At the same time, educators do not want to undermine or discount the enormous value of face-to-face educational experience (Garrison 2011). My immediate reaction is that modern workplaces are looking for a similar balance.

At this point I should note that I am exactly one lecture into this material! Disclaimer aside, I wonder if there is scope for soft skills training that borrows from distance education research. Take the educational Community of Inquiry (COI) for example. Garrison (2011, p.11) refers to a COI as “a group of individuals who collaboratively engage in purposeful critical discourse and reﬂection to construct personal meaning and conﬁrm mutual understanding”. This is particularly interesting in the context of soft skills because it reckons with the concept of social presence. Social presence is “the ability of participants in a community of inquiry to project themselves socially and emotionally, as ‘real’ people (i.e., their full personality), through the medium of communication being used” (Garrison _et al._ 1999, p.94).

For software engineers, the medium of communication is asynchronous text. Microsoft Teams and Slack brought text-based group chats to the workplace. Of course, a group chat is very different to a face-to-face conversation. Body language and verbal intonation can have a profound effect on how people interpret messages (Garrison 2011). Can the nature of written language compensate for the lack of in-person cues? Academic research tells us that students can and do overcome the lack of non-verbal communication by establishing familiarity through the use of greetings, encouragement, and personal disclosure (Garrison 2011).

I have only scratched the surface of a complex area of research, but what I have read so far is promising. I am hopeful that the principles behind frameworks like the COI are transferrable to industry. If so, then I am interested to learn more about creating a quality learning environment where engineers can develop soft skills. Of course, for that to happen, employers need to acknowledge the role that soft skills play in the success of their business and invest in their people. Software, after all, is a people business.
